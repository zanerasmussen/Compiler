This project only entails the lexer as of right now. I am using Python. 

To run use the command line with a file as an argument. 

Things to add:
    add -l to command line
    finish test cases
<<<<<<< HEAD
    look at EOF stuff?
=======
    Add EOF token
    
    #FIXME Single quoted stuff = error if not char

    Questions for Aldous
    1) String literal (why does the spec exclude then include them) answered
    2) Char literal
    3) are all 'other terminals' terminals? [no]
    4) file type for command line. (CAT built in?) 
    Cat dumpts text files to terminal
    look into cat.
