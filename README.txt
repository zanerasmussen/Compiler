This project only entails the lexer as of right now. I am using Python. 

To run the lexer, go to the file directory in a terminal and run 'python3 main.py'
You can pass it a parameter of different files or you can not pass a file and it will run the default data.txt

Things to add:
    add -l to command line
    finish test cases

<<<<<<< HEAD

Lexer Branch
python3 -m PyInstaller -F ./main.py

Suggestions:
read fron standard in instead of default file
line 74 should faile because of the new line token. unit test for ath.
